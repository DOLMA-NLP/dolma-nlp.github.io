The western part of Asia, known as the Middle East or Near East, is a linguistically diverse region crucial for geopolitical and economic reasons. Home to over 300 million people speaking more than 30 languages from various language families, this area faces significant linguistic challenges. Many languages, particularly those in Turkey, Syria, Iran, and Iraq, suffer from discrimination and neglect, impacting their usage and preservation. Without immediate action, we risk losing invaluable linguistic and cultural heritage.

### Why DOLMA-NLP?
<p align="justify">
Our project focuses on creating parallel corpora and developing language technology for several languages in the Middle East, such as Zazaki, Gorani, Southern Kurdish, Mazanderani, Gilaki, Laki, and Luri. These languages, with speaker populations ranging from 250,000 to 5 million, represent a crucial yet underserved linguistic group. By developing resources for these languages, we can catalyze progress in language technology and machine translation, addressing a critical gap in the region's linguistic landscape. Due to the lack of financial support, working on these languages has been a dream for a long time. Now, thanks to the SILICON Fellowship, an ideal occasion is presented to extend this research and collaborate with experts in the field to leverage current technological advancements to ensure these languages thrive in the digital age.
