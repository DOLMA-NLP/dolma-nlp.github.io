title: "PARME Paper Recognized as Outstanding at ACL 2025 üèÜ"
---

We are incredibly excited to announce that our [PARME paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1451/) has been recognized as an **outstanding paper at ACL 2025**! 

This achievement represents far more than academic recognition; it's a meaningful step forward for low-resourced language communities across the Middle East who have long been underserved by existing NLP technologies. The research addresses critical gaps in language representation and processing capabilities, offering new pathways for these communities to participate more fully in the digital age. ACL has always felt like a second home to us, with its vibrant community of brilliant researchers and the inspiring atmosphere of collaboration that drives innovation in computational linguistics.

This incredible initiative could never have been realized without the dedication and expertise of so many amazing volunteers who believed in the importance of this work. From native speakers who contributed linguistic expertise to researchers who offered technical guidance, and community members who helped with data collection and validation‚Äîeach contribution has been invaluable in bringing this project to life. We are deeply grateful to everyone who supported this endeavor and helped make it possible. We hope this recognition and the work itself will pave the way for more research focused on underrepresented languages and communities, fostering a more inclusive and equitable future for natural language processing technologies worldwide.
