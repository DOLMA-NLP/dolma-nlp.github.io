We are thrilled to announce that DOLMA-NLP has been accepted into the prestigious Stanford Initiative on Language Inclusion and Conservation in Old and New Media (SILICON)! 

This incredible opportunity will allow us to further our mission of advancing digitally disadvantaged languages in the Middle East. Through this program, we will receive support to propel our project forward, collaborating with experts and leveraging cutting-edge technology to preserve and develop essential resources for these underserved languages.
